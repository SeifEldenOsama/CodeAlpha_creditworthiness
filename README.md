I developed a machine learning model to predict credit worthiness and loan approval likelihood. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. I applied SMOTE to handle class imbalance and evaluated performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, and detailed visualization. This task helped me strengthen my skills in Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and real-world financial risk modeling.
